\section{Introducton}
\label{01}

This report has been written as part of a project on the Game Engines E2013 (MGAE-E2013) course on the Games course at the IT-University of Copenhagen.

For this assignment I have created a game engine for a 2D platformer game, written in C++ with the use of the SDL framework\footnote{http://www.libsdl.org/}. I have worked, and shared ideas, with Jakob Melnyk (jmel).
