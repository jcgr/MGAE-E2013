The engine is intended to support simple 2D platform games built in tiles, where jumping and avoiding enemies while trying to reach a goal area are the key points. The engine contains the following features:

\begin{my_itemize}

	\item A player that has the ability to walk and jump.

	\item Enemies that fly or walk. In the case of the walking enemy, it is also affected by gravity.

	\item Collision detection, both between entities (player/enemies) and the walls, and between the player and the enemies.

	\item A side-scrolling camera that follows the player.

	\item Animations for entities.
