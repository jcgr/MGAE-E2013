\section{Introducton}
\label{01}

This report has been written as part of a project on the Game Engines E2013 (MGAE-E2013) course on the Games course at the IT-University of Copenhagen. 

For the project, I have written a program in C\# that illustrates one agent chasing another through the use of the A* algorithm. I have worked, and shared ideas, with Jakob Melnyk (jmel).
