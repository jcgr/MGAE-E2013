\section{Conclusion}
\label{05}

The program I have written allows for rendering of simple wireframe models. Furthermore, the program allows the user to move the camera around in the model view space and inspect the model from different angles. However, large models/scenes would be problematic to render due to the lack of optimization during the calculations.

\subsection{Future works}
\label{05_01}
There are plenty of things that could be changed in the future.

As it is now, there are a lot of unnecessary calculations, and there are cases where the calculations result in the program crashing. This could be avoided by proper optimizing of the calculations and checking if the calculations are within the expected scope.

The camera could also use some changing. The main thing to focus on would be to allow the mouse to control the camera, instead of having to use the keyboard. The keyboard is a clunky way of controlling the camera, and it not very precise.  Changing how the camera rotates would also be part of this work.
