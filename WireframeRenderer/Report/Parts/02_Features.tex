\section{Features}
\label{02}

In this section I will describe the two main features of the program: Rendering and camera movement.

\subsection{Rendering}
\label{02_01}
The program utilises a list of triangles created from vertices for rendering. The program calculates the location of each triangle on the screen based on the camera's variables and draws them to the screen.

\subsection{Camera Movement}
\label{02_02}
The camera can be moved around to display the wireframe model from different angles and positions. The controls for moving it are:
\begin{my_itemize}
	\item 'a' and 'd' moves the camera on the x-axis.
	\item 'w' and 's' moves the camera on the y-axis.
	\item 'q' and 'e' moves the camera on the z-axis.
	\item 'j' and 'l' moves the look point of the camera on the x-axis.
	\item 'i' and 'k' moves the look point of the camera on the y-axis.
	\item 'u' and 'o' moves the look point of the camera on the z-axis.
\end{my_itemize}
