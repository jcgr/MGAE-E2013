\section{Introducton}
\label{01}

This report has been written as part of a project on the Game Engines E2013 (MGAE-E2013) course on the Games course at the IT-University of Copenhagen. 

For the project, I have written a program in C\# (with the use of Windows Forms) that can render simple wireframe models. For the calculations, I followed the the "Overview of transforms used in rendering"\footnote{https://blog.itu.dk/MGAE-E2013/files/2013/09/transforms.pdf} tutorial by Mark Nelson. The program has been written in C\#. I have worked, and shared ideas, with Jakob Melnyk (jmel).
